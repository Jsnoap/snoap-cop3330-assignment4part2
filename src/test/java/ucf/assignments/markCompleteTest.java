        This test will test the ability of the App to mark a created task as complete.
        By using an object of a "CheckBox" this visually allows the user to see
        if their task is marked as complete or not.

        There are functions with a CheckBox to test this such as "setSelected(boolean value)" and "isSelected()"
        to change the value of the CheckBox.
        These values cannot be tested here but using a CheckBox Object is enough to satisfy this case
